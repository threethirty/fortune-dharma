Generating the Mind for Enlightenment
	With a wish to free all beings
	I shall always go for refuge
	to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha
	until I reach full enlightenment.

	Enthused by wisdom and compassion,
	today in the Buddha?s presence
	I generate the Mind for Full Awakening
	for the benefit of all sentient beings.

	As long as space endures,
	as long as sentient being remain,
	until then, may I too remain
	and dispel the miseries of the world.

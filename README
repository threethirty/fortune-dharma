fortune Dharma

Bringing dharma teachings, to your fortune cookies :)



==========================
Dependencies
==========================
the `fortune` command, usually included in bsd-games

==========================
Install
==========================
$> make
$> make install DESTDIR=/path/of/your/choice

This lands the fortune files in "/usr/share/games/fortunes".
If you need these fortune files elsewhere pass the following:
$> make install fortunedir=/path/of/your/choice

To enable it on a typical login prompt, just make 
the profile file executable.
#> chmod +x /etc/profile.d/dharma-login-fortune.*sh
